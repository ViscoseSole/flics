# flics

/_ NOT READY! (AT ALL) _/

A Netflix clone but simply a working movie database with user authentication. For this project I didn't use create-react-app but set up my own "boilerplate" with webpack (With an auto-updating dev server & SASS/ES2015 compilers). UI/State-Management is built using React, React-Router and Redux.

## Usage

1.  `git clone https://github.com/ViscoseSole/flics`
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm run start`
4.  Find project at `localhost:8080`
