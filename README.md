# Flics (This project is very much so under development.)

A 'Netflix clone' or simply a movie database with user authentication. For this project I didn't use the create-react-app boilerplate but set up a custom development environment with webpack (With auto-updating dev server, ES2015/JSX/SASS compilers). For UI/State-Management I used React and React-Router.

## Installation

1.  `git clone https://github.com/ViscoseSole/flics`
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm start`
4.  Find project at `localhost:3000`
